<h1>How CBD Can Help You in Quitting Addiction?</h1>
<p>In the last twenty years, scientists have done a lot of researches on cannabis-derived products. As a result of these studies, many new chemicals have been discovered inside these plants. The most prominent chemicals in the hemp plant have been found to be cannabinoids and terpenes. Cannabinoids are the chemicals that especially get scientists&rsquo; attention because of the way they act on the human body.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of cannabinoids in the marijuana plant, but we know the most about CBD and THC. In fact, CBD was the cannabinoid ever discovered by the research of Dr. Mechoulam. Afterward, Tetrahydrocannabinol or THC was found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both of these cannabinoids act on the Endocannabinoid system inside the body. Simply put, there are receptors throughout the body where cannabinoids act. You may be surprised to know the fact that the human body also makes cannabinoids. These are called endocannabinoids, and the cells make these chemicals for communicating signals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past, research on cannabis was not an easy task at all. The reasons were mostly the legal status, fear of addiction, and racism. Because of these problems, scientific research in the field was obstructed. This is why there is not much research data on how the cannabinoids and endocannabinoid system work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the major researches in this line are done in the last twenty years. Now, the legal status of hemp and marijuana has changed in many parts of the world, which has opened the path for new researches. Among the two famous cannabinoids, CBD is the one catching a lot of attention because of the health benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>CBD Industry</h2>
<p>There are many CBD products you can find in the market, and with more research on the benefits of CBD, these numbers are increasing. Among other products, CBD vape cartridges are one of the most famous. I used to work in a packaging making company, and <a href="https://uscbdboxes.com/cbd-cartridge-boxes/">the custom CBD cartridge box</a> packaging was the highest in demand of CBD packaging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the biggest reasons for the popularity of CBD joints and vape cartridges is the fact that they can help with stress without causing any addiction. WHO has stated the fact that cannabidiol does not make you dependant. In contrast, a recent study by Dr. Yasmin Hurd has shown that CBD can be effective against addiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>CBD Against Addiction</h2>
<p>In Dr. Hurd&rsquo;s study, first, the effects of CBD were studied on heroin-dependent rats. The results showed that on treatment with cannabidiol, the rats were less likely to show any craving towards the opioid. The results of this research led to the testing with humans to confirm the suspected effects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the human testing, forty-two heroin addicts were tested. In the testing, a control group was given a placebo, whereas others were given doses of CBD. After the end of the three months, even after artificially induced craving, people were not likely to get the craving for opioids. It turns out that the CBD was more successful than the traditional placebo. Another advantage CBD had over the medicine is the lesser number of side effects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After this research, it is expected that CBD can help against various addictions, including tobacco, marijuana, opioids, and other drugs. For now, more research data is required to back the claim that CBD products help with addiction. But the current results are promising, and in the upcoming years, we may see proper CBD based medication against addiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With better resources for research and more availability of hemp-based products in the market, it is expected that soon research will result in a final statement about the effects of CBD products against addiction. By that time, it is safe to say that cannabidiol may help against addiction. Yet further data is needed.</p>
